1. Sort individuals into different labor force categories
=IF(WORKYN = 1, IF(A_WKSTAT = 2, "FULL TIME", "OTHER WORKER), IF(RSNNOTW =2, "Retired", IF(RSNNOTW = 1, "Disabled", IF(E2=3, "Children", IF(RSNNOTW = 4, "Student",IF(RSNNOTW =3, "Carer", IF(RSNNOTW - 5, "Unemployed, "Other Non-Worker"))))))
Replace the Census variables with whatever column you have them as in your spreadsheet. 


2. Sort different incomes into percentile rankings
=ROUND(RANK.EQ(Unit_Market_Income, 1)/COUNT(Unit_Market_Income),2)
Replace the Unit Market Income variable with the total column of market incomes you have created
Same basic process for disposable income. This is relatively processor heavy so make yourself a cup of coffee.
